# 100 Days Full Stack Developer Challenge

## ðŸ“… Challenge Overview

Welcome to my **100 Days Full Stack Developer Challenge**! In this challenge, Iâ€™m aiming to become a proficient full-stack developer by following a structured learning path that covers everything from **frontend** technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, to **backend** technologies such as **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Databases**, and **APIs**.

Each day, I will share my learning and coding progress on this GitHub profile. This repository will act as a **diary** of my development journey, where I will upload all the code and projects that I build along the way.

**The goal** is to go from being a beginner to a full-stack developer capable of building real-world applications.

## ðŸ“š What I will learn in 100 Days

Here's a breakdown of the main topics and technologies I'll be covering over the next 100 days:

- **Frontend Development:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
  - React.js or Angular
  - Responsive Design & Accessibility
  - CSS Frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, TailwindCSS)

- **Backend Development:**
  - Node.js & Express.js
  - RESTful APIs
  - Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
  - WebSocket for real-time applications

- **Database Management:**
  - SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
  - NoSQL (MongoDB)
  - ORMs (Sequelize, Mongoose)

- **Version Control:**
  - Git & GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
  - Branching, Merging, Pull Requests

- **Deployment:**
  - Deploying apps using Heroku, AWS, and Netlify
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **Testing:**
  - Unit Testing (Jest, Mocha, Chai)
  - Integration Testing

- **Miscellaneous:**
  - Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)
  - GitHub Projects and Issues for project management
  - Code Reviews

## ðŸš€ How This Repository is Organized

The repository will be structured in the following way:

  - Learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
  - Build small static websites and interactive forms.
  
- **Day 11-30**: **Advanced JavaScript & React Basics**
  - Learn ES6+ features, asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await).
  - Introduction to React.js: components, state, props, hooks.
  - Build a small React project like a to-do list or weather app.

- **Day 31-60**: **Node.js, Express.js, and APIs**
  - Learn Node.js basics and Express.js framework.
  - Build REST APIs and connect them with a frontend.
  - Implement authentication using JWT.

- **Day 61-80**: **Database Integration & Testing**
  - Learn SQL and NoSQL databases (MySQL, MongoDB).
  - Implement CRUD operations and integrate databases with backend.
  - Write unit tests for both frontend and backend using Jest or Mocha.

- **Day 81-100**: **Advanced Topics, Deployment, and Final Project**
  - Deployment of the full-stack app to Heroku or AWS.
  - Advanced topics like WebSockets, GraphQL, or Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
  - Final full-stack project that integrates frontend, backend, and a database.

## ðŸ“… Daily Commit Log

Each day, I will upload my code to this repository and provide a short **commit message** summarizing what I learned and built. You can find my progress in the following directory structure:
